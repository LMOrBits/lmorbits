# Infrastructure as Code

## Application Development

Welcome to the application development documentation! Here you'll find comprehensive guides for working with different components of our platform.

### Development Areas

* [Tools](../lmorbits/APP/TOOLS/)
* [Workflows](../lmorbits/APP/WORKFLOWS/)
* [VectorDB](../lmorbits/APP/VECTORDB/)

## Application Package

The application package contains the core business logic and application components of our project, organized into distinct modules for workflows, vector databases, and tools.

### Package Structure

```
application/
├── configs/         # Application configurations
├── src/            # Main source code
│   ├── workflows/  # Workflow definitions
│   ├── vectordb/   # Vector database operations
│   ├── tools/      # Utility tools
└── pyproject.toml  # Package dependencies and configuration
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Workflows Module

The workflows module manages the llm workflows:

* Process definitions
* State management
* Event handling
* Task orchestration

#### 2. Vector Database Module

The vectordb module handles vector-based operations:

* Vector storage and retrieval
* Similarity search
* Embedding management
* Index optimization

#### 3. Tools Module

The tools module provides utility functions and helpers:

* Common utilities
* Helper functions
* Shared components
* Development tools

### Configuration

#### Environment Setup

The package requires Python 3.11+ and has minimal dependencies:

```bash
# Install base dependencies
pip install -e .
```

#### Application Configuration

Configurations are managed in the `configs/` directory:

```yaml
# Example configuration
application:
  workflows:
    max_concurrent: 10
    timeout: 300
  vectordb:
    index_type: hnsw
    dimensions: 768
```

### Usage

#### Workflow Management

```python
from application.workflows import WorkflowManager

# Initialize workflow
workflow = WorkflowManager()

# Define and execute workflow
workflow.define("process_name")
workflow.execute()
```

#### Vector Database Operations

```python
from application.vectordb import VectorStore

# Initialize vector store
store = VectorStore()

# Store and query vectors
store.add_vectors(vectors)
results = store.query(query_vector)
```

#### Utility Tools

```python
from application.tools import utils

# Use utility functions
utils.process_data()
utils.validate_input()
```

### Best Practices

1. **Workflow Development**
   * Define clear process boundaries
   * Implement proper error handling
   * Document workflow states
   * Monitor workflow performance
2. **Vector Database Usage**
   * Optimize index configurations
   * Implement batch operations
   * Monitor memory usage
   * Regular maintenance
3. **Code Organization**
   * Follow modular design
   * Implement proper testing
   * Use type hints
   * Document components

### Integration with Other Packages

The application package integrates with:

* `ml`: For model integration
* `data`: For data access
* `orchestration`: For process orchestration
* `serve`: For deployment

### Development Guidelines

1. **Code Structure**
   * Keep modules focused and cohesive
   * Follow single responsibility principle
   * Implement proper error handling
   * Document public interfaces
2. **Testing**
   * Write unit tests
   * Test integration points
   * Validate workflows
   * Test error conditions
3. **Documentation**
   * Document module purposes
   * Provide usage examples
   * Document configurations
   * Keep API documentation updated

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Workflow Issues**
   * Check workflow state
   * Verify process definitions
   * Monitor execution logs
   * Check dependencies
2. **Vector Database Problems**
   * Verify index configuration
   * Check memory usage
   * Monitor query performance
   * Validate vector dimensions
3. **Tool Integration**
   * Check dependency versions
   * Verify tool configurations
   * Monitor tool performance
   * Check integration points
