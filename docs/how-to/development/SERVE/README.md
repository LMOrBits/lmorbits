# Serve Package

The serve package is responsible for model serving and deployment, providing a robust infrastructure for deploying machine learning models in production.

## Package Structure

```
serve/
├── models/          # Model artifacts and configurations
├── mlruns/         # MLflow tracking
├── src/            # Main source code
├── secrets/        # Sensitive configurations
├── compose.yaml    # Docker compose configuration
├── Makefile        # Build and deployment commands
└── pyproject.toml  # Package dependencies and configuration
```

## Key Features

### 1. Model Serving

The package provides comprehensive model serving capabilities:
- LLaMA model serving via `llama-cpp-python`
- MLflow model tracking and versioning
- Google Cloud Storage integration
- CLI interface for management

### 2. Deployment Tools

The package includes deployment and management tools:
- Docker containerization
- Compose-based orchestration
- Build automation with Make
- Monitoring and logging

### 3. Package Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- `llama-cpp-python`: LLaMA model serving
- `mlflow`: Model tracking and management
- `google-cloud-storage`: Cloud storage integration
- `click`: CLI interface
- `loguru`: Logging system

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

The package requires Python 3.12+ and specific dependencies:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Docker Configuration

The service can be deployed using Docker Compose:
```yaml
# Example compose.yaml
services:
  serve:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./models:/app/models
    environment:
      - MODEL_PATH=/app/models/llama
```

## Usage

### CLI Interface

The package provides a command-line interface:
```bash
# Start the serving service
serve start

# List available models
serve list-models

# Load a specific model
serve load-model --path models/llama
```

### Model Management

```python
from serve.models import ModelManager

# Initialize model manager
manager = ModelManager()

# Load and serve model
manager.load_model("llama")
response = manager.predict(input_text)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Deployment**
   - Version models properly
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Implement health checks
   - Set up proper logging

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Configure model serving parameters
   - Implement request batching
   - Monitor latency
   - Optimize resource usage

3. **Security**
   - Secure sensitive configurations
   - Implement authentication
   - Monitor access logs
   - Regular security updates

## Integration with Other Packages

The serve package integrates with:
- `ml`: For model artifacts
- `orchestration`: For deployment coordination
- `application`: For business logic integration

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Structure**
   - Keep services modular
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Document APIs
   - Write comprehensive tests

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Use container orchestration
   - Implement rolling updates
   - Monitor deployments
   - Maintain backup strategies

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up health checks
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Track model performance
   - Log important events

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Model Loading Issues**
   - Check model path
   - Verify model format
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check dependencies

2. **Performance Problems**
   - Monitor request latency
   - Check resource utilization
   - Verify batch processing
   - Optimize configurations

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check container logs
   - Verify network settings
   - Monitor resource limits
   - Check configuration files

## Development Setup

1. **Local Development**
```bash
# Set up environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

2. **Docker Development**
```bash
# Build container
docker compose build

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

3. **Testing**
```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f serve
```
