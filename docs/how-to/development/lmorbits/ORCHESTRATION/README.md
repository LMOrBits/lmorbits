# Orchestration

The orchestration package is the central component that manages and coordinates all ML workflows in our project using ZenML.

## Package Structure

```
orchestration/
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks for pipeline development
├── scripts/         # Utility and automation scripts
├── secrets/         # Configuration for sensitive information
├── src/            # Main source code
├── Taskfile.yml    # Task automation definitions
├── Makefile        # Build and development commands
└── pyproject.toml  # Package dependencies and configuration
```

## Key Features

### 1. ZenML Integration

We use ZenML as our orchestration framework for:

* Pipeline definition and management
* Experiment tracking
* Artifact management
* Environment management
* Stack configuration

### 2. Development Tools

The package includes several development tools:

* Task automation via `Taskfile.yml`
* Build commands via `Makefile`
* Environment management with `uv`
* Code quality tools (ruff for linting and formatting)

### 3. Package Dependencies

The orchestration package integrates with other project packages:

* `ml`: Machine learning models and training
* `data`: Data processing and management
* `application`: Business logic and API
* `serve`: Model serving

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The package uses `.env` files for configuration:

```
# Example .env configuration
ZENML_SERVER_URL=...
ZENML_USERNAME=...
ZENML_PASSWORD=...
```

### Development vs Production

The package supports different environments:

1. **Development**
   * Local ZenML server
   * Debug logging enabled
   * Hot-reloading for faster development
2. **Production**
   * Remote ZenML server
   * Optimized logging
   * Production-grade security

## Usage

### Setting Up

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

2. Configure environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations
```

3. Initialize ZenML:

```bash
task init
```

### Running Pipelines

Use the task runner for common operations:

```bash
task run-pipeline
task list-pipelines
task clean
```

## Best Practices

1. **Pipeline Organization**
   * Keep pipeline definitions modular
   * Use step caching appropriately
   * Implement proper error handling
2. **Configuration Management**
   * Use environment variables for sensitive data
   * Keep configurations version controlled
   * Document all configuration options
3. **Development Workflow**
   * Follow the branching strategy
   * Use task automation for common operations
   * Keep notebooks organized and documented

## Utilities

The package includes several utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

* Pipeline management
* Environment setup
* Debugging tools
* Cleanup scripts

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **ZenML Connection Issues**
   * Check environment variables
   * Verify network connectivity
   * Ensure proper authentication
2. **Pipeline Failures**
   * Check logs in ZenML UI
   * Verify step configurations
   * Check resource availability
3. **Development Environment**
   * Verify virtual environment activation
   * Check dependency versions
   * Ensure proper tool installation
