Popular Alternatives
	•	Natural Questions (NQ):
A large-scale dataset from Google that pairs real user search queries with entire Wikipedia pages. Annotators mark long passages and short answer spans. Its real-world questions and lengthy contexts make it a popular benchmark for open-domain QA.
￼
	•	TriviaQA:
This dataset contains around 95,000 question–answer pairs along with evidence documents from both Wikipedia and the web. Its diverse sources and challenging questions provide a good testbed for models that need to extract answer spans from noisy, real-world text.
￼
	•	NewsQA:
Focused on the news domain, NewsQA offers questions based on CNN articles. Like SQuAD, it pairs a question with a context passage and an answer span, but the news domain introduces its own challenges (e.g., varying writing styles and topical language).
	•	HotpotQA:
Designed for multi-hop reasoning, HotpotQA not only provides a question, context, and answer but also requires the model to combine information from multiple Wikipedia articles. This makes it a more challenging alternative if your interest is in multi-step reasoning.
	•	Conversational Datasets (QuAC and CoQA):
If you are interested in dialogue or context-dependent questioning, consider:
	•	QuAC (Question Answering in Context):
It features interactive dialogues where a student asks follow-up questions and a teacher provides answers (spans from a hidden context).
￼
	•	CoQA (Conversational Question Answering):
Similar to QuAC, CoQA is designed for conversational settings, providing a series of interlinked questions over a given passage.
